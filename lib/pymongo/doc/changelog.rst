Changes in Version 1.7
----------------------

Version 1.7 is a recommended upgrade for all PyMongo users. The full release notes are below, and some more in depth discussion of the highlights is `here <http://dirolf.com/2010/06/17/pymongo-1.7-released.html>`_.

- no longer attempt to build the C extension on big-endian systems.
- added :class:`~pymongo.min_key.MinKey` and
  :class:`~pymongo.max_key.MaxKey`.
- use unsigned for :class:`~pymongo.timestamp.Timestamp` in BSON
  encoder/decoder.
- support ``True`` as ``"ok"`` in command responses, in addition to
  ``1.0`` - necessary for server versions **>= 1.5.X**
- BREAKING change to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.index_information` to add
  support for querying unique status and other index information.
- added :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.document_class`, to
  specify class for returned documents.
- added `as_class` argument for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`, and in the BSON decoder.
- added support for creating :class:`~pymongo.timestamp.Timestamp`
  instances using a :class:`~datetime.datetime`.
- allow `dropTarget` argument for
  :class:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.rename`.
- handle aware :class:`~datetime.datetime` instances, by converting to
  UTC.
- added support for :class:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.max_scan`.
- raise :class:`~gridfs.errors.FileExists` exception when creating a
  duplicate GridFS file.
- use `y2038 <http://code.google.com/p/y2038/>`_ for time handling in
  the C extension - eliminates 2038 problems when extension is
  installed.
- added `sort` parameter to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`
- finalized deprecation of changes from versions **<= 1.4**
- take any non-:class:`dict` as an ``"_id"`` query for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one` or
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.remove`
- added ability to pass a :class:`dict` for `fields` argument to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find` (supports ``"$slice"``
  and field negation)
- simplified code to find master, since paired setups don't always have
  a remote
- fixed bug in C encoder for certain invalid types (like
  :class:`~pymongo.collection.Collection` instances).
- don't transparently map ``"filename"`` key to :attr:`name` attribute
  for GridFS.

Changes in Version 1.6
----------------------

The biggest change in version 1.6 is a complete re-implementation of
:mod:`gridfs` with a lot of improvements over the old
implementation. There are many details and examples of using the new
API in `this blog post
<http://dirolf.com/2010/03/29/new-gridfs-implementation-for-pymongo.html>`_. The
old API has been removed in this version, so existing code will need
to be modified before upgrading to 1.6.

- fixed issue where connection pool was being shared across
  :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` instances.
- more improvements to Python code caching in C extension - should
  improve behavior on mod_wsgi.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.objectid.ObjectId.from_datetime`.
- complete rewrite of :mod:`gridfs` support.
- improvements to the :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command` API.
- fixed :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.drop_indexes` behavior
  on non-existent collections.
- disallow empty bulk inserts.

Changes in Version 1.5.2
------------------------
- fixed response handling to ignore unknown response flags in queries.
- handle server versions containing '-pre-'.

Changes in Version 1.5.1
------------------------
- added :data:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridFile._id` property for
  :class:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridFile` instances.
- fix for making a :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` (with
  `slave_okay` set) directly to a slave in a replica pair.
- accept kwargs for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.ensure_index` to support all
  indexing options.
- add :data:`pymongo.GEO2D` and support for geo indexing.
- improvements to Python code caching in C extension - should improve
  behavior on mod_wsgi.

Changes in Version 1.5
----------------------
- added subtype constants to :mod:`~pymongo.binary` module.
- DEPRECATED `options` argument to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.create_collection` in favor of
  kwargs.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.has_c` to check for C extension.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.copy_database`.
- added :data:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.alive` to tell when a cursor
  might have more data to return (useful for tailable cursors).
- added :class:`~pymongo.timestamp.Timestamp` to better support
  dealing with internal MongoDB timestamps.
- added `name` argument for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.ensure_index`.
- fixed connection pooling w/ fork
- :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.paired` takes all kwargs that
  are allowed for :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`.
- :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert` returns list for bulk
  inserts of size one.
- fixed handling of :class:`datetime.datetime` instances in
  :mod:`~pymongo.json_util`.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.from_uri` to support
  MongoDB connection uri scheme.
- fixed chunk number calculation when unaligned in :mod:`gridfs`.
- :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command` takes a string for simple
  commands.
- added :data:`~pymongo.database.Database.system_js` helper for
  dealing with server-side JS.
- don't wrap queries containing ``"$query"`` (support manual use of
  ``"$min"``, etc.).
- added :class:`~gridfs.errors.GridFSError` as base class for
  :mod:`gridfs` exceptions.

Changes in Version 1.4
----------------------

Perhaps the most important change in version 1.4 is that we have
decided to **no longer support Python 2.3**. The most immediate reason
for this is to allow some improvements to connection pooling. This
will also allow us to use some new (as in Python 2.4 ;) idioms and
will help begin the path towards supporting Python 3.0. If you need to
use Python 2.3 you should consider using version 1.3 of this driver,
although that will no longer be actively supported.

Other changes:

- move ``"_id"`` to front only for top-level documents (fixes some
  corner cases).
- :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.update` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.remove` return the entire
  response to the *lastError* command when safe is ``True``.
- completed removal of things that were deprecated in version 1.2 or
  earlier.
- enforce that collection names do not contain the NULL byte.
- fix to allow using UTF-8 collection names with the C extension.
- added :class:`~pymongo.errors.PyMongoError` as base exception class
  for all :mod:`~pymongo.errors`. this changes the exception hierarchy
  somewhat, and is a BREAKING change if you depend on
  :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` being a :class:`IOError`
  or :class:`~pymongo.errors.InvalidBSON` being a :class:`ValueError`,
  for example.
- added :class:`~pymongo.errors.DuplicateKeyError` for calls to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert` or
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.update` with `safe` set to
  ``True``.
- removed :mod:`~pymongo.thread_util`.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.add_user` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.remove_user` helpers.
- fix for :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.authenticate` when using
  non-UTF-8 names or passwords.
- minor fixes for
  :class:`~pymongo.master_slave_connection.MasterSlaveConnection`.
- clean up all cases where :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure`
  is raised.
- simplification of connection pooling - makes driver ~2x faster for
  simple benchmarks. see :ref:`connection-pooling` for more information.
- DEPRECATED `pool_size`, `auto_start_request` and `timeout`
  parameters to :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`. DEPRECATED
  :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.start_request`.
- use :meth:`socket.sendall`.
- removed :meth:`~pymongo.son.SON.from_xml` as it was only being used
  for some internal testing - also eliminates dependency on
  :mod:`elementtree`.
- implementation of :meth:`~pymongo.message.update` in C.
- deprecate :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database._command` in favor of
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command`.
- send all commands without wrapping as ``{"query": ...}``.
- support string as `key` argument to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group` (keyf) and run all
  groups as commands.
- support for equality testing for :class:`~pymongo.code.Code`
  instances.
- allow the NULL byte in strings and disallow it in key names or regex
  patterns

Changes in Version 1.3
----------------------
- DEPRECATED running :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group` as
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.eval`, also changed default for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group` to running as a command
- remove :meth:`pymongo.cursor.Cursor.__len__`, which was deprecated
  in 1.1.1 - needed to do this aggressively due to it's presence
  breaking **Django** template *for* loops
- DEPRECATED :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.host`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.port`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.connection`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.name`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.database`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.name` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.full_name` in favor of
  :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.host`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.port`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.database.Database.connection`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.database.Database.name`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.database`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.name` and
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.full_name`, respectively. The
  deprecation schedule for this change will probably be faster than
  usual, as it carries some performance implications.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.disconnect`

Changes in Version 1.2.1
------------------------
- added :doc:`changelog` to docs

  now optional to allow for deleting all documents in a
  :class:`~pymongo.collection.Collection`
- always wrap queries with ``{query: ...}`` even when no special options -
  get around some issues with queries on fields named ``query``
- enforce 4MB document limit on the client side
- added :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce` helper - see
  :doc:`example <examples/map_reduce>`
- added :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.distinct` method on
  :class:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor` instances to allow distinct with
  queries
- fix for :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.__getitem__` after
  :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.skip`
- allow any UTF-8 string in :class:`~pymongo.bson.BSON` encoder, not
  just ASCII subset
- added :attr:`~pymongo.objectid.ObjectId.generation_time`

  format - pretty sure this was never used, and is just confusing
- DEPRECATED :meth:`~pymongo.objectid.ObjectId.url_encode` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.objectid.ObjectId.url_decode` in favor of :meth:`str`
  and :meth:`~pymongo.objectid.ObjectId`, respectively
